WHAT
===============================================================
This is the mobile client for http://iknowwhere.net which was 
created at a weekend hackathon, http://aaltoes.com/build-it/, 
in March 2012. 

The basic idea is to take pictures and upload them. Then other 
people can try to guess where that picture is taken by 
actually visiting the location and verifying it via the app.


TECH
===============================================================
- Android
- Javascript/Html/Css
- PhoneGap / Cordova
- RequireJS
- jQuery
- Backbone


DEVELOP
===============================================================
There's not much to see on the Java side as most of the app
is built in html/javascript using PhoneGap/Cordova to access 
some Phone APIs.

- You can use Eclipse with Google's Android plugin to deploy 
  to a development phone.
- You can use Chrome to develop on the desktop (resize to mimic 
  a mobile screen). Note that you'll have to start chrome with 
  some flags to allow execution of javascript from "file://"
  urls.  
- You'll probably want the backend project too (phunt-web)
